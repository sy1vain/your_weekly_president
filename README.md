## Files needes

Next to the project directory we need a directory named `ywp` containing the following files:

* `settings.json`
* `ywp.mp4`

There are several locations where these files can be placed. On raspberry pi the default locations is `/home/pi/ywp`

The names for the files (except `settings.json`) can be changed in the `settings.json`
